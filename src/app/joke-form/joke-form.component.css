/* by default component styles are encapsulated which makes sure that the css for a component does not leak into other components */

/* Angular is built on web components, which uses the shadow dom: this allows us to apply styles to parts of the web components
 /* without it leaking outside the web components scope
 This in angular is called View Encapsulation. */

/* we can control it with the encapsulation property (on the @Component decorator called encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated etc) on the components.
 valid values are: native, emulated and none
 the default is emulated */

/* so although the joke-form and the joke components htmls both use the card css, only the joke-form card's styling will be affected by the extended .card prop
 this is known as view encapsulation in Angular.
 in old js, it would have changed the background color for every html element that uses the .card css
 i.e.: both joke and joke-form */
