<!-- NB: that the routerLinks for the tracks and albums  use the ./tracks or ./albums (which is the same as just tracks or albums)
    and this is because as the tracks & albums components are children routes of the Artist components
    I want it to have the absolute url:
      - http://localhost:4200/#/artist/someArtistId/tracks or
      - http://localhost:4200/#/artist/someArtistId/albums

      INstead of http://localhost:4200/#/tracks or http://localhost:4200/#/albums -->

      <!-- we could have also done tracks or albums which also equals tracks or albums -->


      <!-- If we wanted the url to use the base root address instead, we would have used /tracks or /albums -->
