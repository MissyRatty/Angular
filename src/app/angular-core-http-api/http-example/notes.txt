Aim of this section is to know how to:

- Inject & use Http client lib
- Send diff types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc)
- Add Custom headers to http requests
- Handle errors from Http requests



Http Client Lib in Angular is a service that can be injected into our component classes to use (DI)
- To use the angular Http client lib, you have to import the HttpModule (which already sets up an NgModule (with the provider (http services needed to perform http actions)))


For POST, PUT & DELETE Requests, the browser first sends an OPTIONS request to the server, to ascertain if the client is allowed to perform the requested request
before it will perform the request.

NOTE: Browser doesn't do that for GET requests


If error handling is done in a promise, use the then().catch()
If error handling is done in an observable, use the second param in the subscribe as the error handler, 
e.g.: subscribe(
                 response => console.log(response), 
                 error => console.error(error)
               )



Http Headers:
These are meta-data that a browser attaches to http requests when its sent to the server. e.g.:   Ip address, type of browser being used, host, origin etc
Some api's may require that some custom headers be added to requests  
In Angular Http Client lib, use the RequestOptions & Headers

e.g.: sending an AuthHeader with a request in Angular, the btoa js func will convert all strings to base64 for you
